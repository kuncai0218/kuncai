Kun Cai — GIS Portfolio

This repository hosts my public GIS portfolio on GitHub Pages. It showcases cartography, interactive web maps, an Android mapping app, and spatial analysis reports. The site is mobile-friendly and uses plain Markdown with images, PDFs, and live demos.

Live site
Update with your Pages URL once published.

Structure
- projects — one Markdown page per project (links to images, PDFs, code, or live demos)
- assets/img — screenshots and poster images
- assets/docs — PDFs (reports, posters, resume)
- index.md — homepage
- achievements.md, skills.md, resume.md — supporting pages

Add a new project
1) Upload screenshots to assets/img and the report/poster PDF to assets/docs.  
2) Create a new page under projects (use relative links like ../assets/docs/file.pdf from inside a project page).  
3) Add the new project link to the “All projects” list in index.md.

Credits
Basemaps and data are credited on each project page. All content is for educational portfolio use.
